Milestone 2 version 1.00 26.10.2017
--------------------------------

New Functionality
-----------------
- Added classes for handling Graphics, and internally handling Sprites and an auxilliary class
Rectangle to handle clipping.
- Graphics also handles all old functions like Draw_Pixel and Clear_Screen.
- Can draw infinite amounts of sprites while just loading them in once.
- Player object can be moved using WASD

Code Additions
--------------
- As mentioned above, most previous code has been consolidated into the Graphics class
- Several performance improvements have been made, such as using a double for loop 
instead of a heavy modulus test, and the blitting technique is dependant on whether the texture
being blitted is on/clipping/off the screen.
- Easy to use Sprite container, using the unordered map, Create_Sprite will first check if there
is an entry with that name, and if no, add it so it can be used later with Draw_Sprite.

Tests
-----
- All tests done in 1500x1000.
- Tested with drawing one set of 1000 "alphaThings" in the same position, and moving them around
the screen, partially out of the screen, and completely off. FPS noticably higher when less of the
"alphaThing" was present on the screen.
- Tested with drawing two sets of 1000 "alpahThings" in two different locations, same results as above.
- Same tests as above also done using Fast_Blit rather than Alpha_Blit, only difference was a noticably
higher FPS as Fast_Blit doesn't take alpha into account.

Legacy notes
-------------
Milestone 1 version 1.00 12.10.2017
--------------------------------

New Functionality
-----------------
- Added speed control w/ left and right mouse buttons
- Can clear screen to colour
- Can set square shapes of pixels to any colour
- Can select any winow size

Code Additions
--------------
- Two major functions, clear screen to colour and find pixel(s)
- Heap array for stars
- No detected memory leaks

Tests
-----
- Tested with 100 000 000 on 800x600 stars for about 6 minutes without anything crashing
- Tested with 800x600 and 1920x1080 with 10 000 stars, and FPS remains within reason and still no crashes
- Gives reasonable impression of 3D space

Notes
-----
- Separate code into functions for modularity.
- Better variable/function names.
